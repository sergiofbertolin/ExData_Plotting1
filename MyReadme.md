#Important!

My Rstudio is set in Spanish, so instead of "Thu", "Fri","Sat" on the corresponding x axis I has "ju.", "vi." and "sá.", 
corresponding to "jueves" (Thursday), "viernes" (Friday) and "sábado" (Saturday). 

The assignment is made automatically by R. To fix this, if you can consider it as an error, 
I have to reinstall the programs in English, so I hope you can unsderstand that I didn't perform this costly operation. 

Excuse me!

##Use of the scripts

If you want to use the scripts, you don't have to set any file. The whole scripts are in charge of download, unzip and use
the correct file.

If you already had the "household_power_consumption.txt" file in your working directory, with the previous specific name, 
none of the scripts download and unzip the file. On this case they start by setting the correct data from the stored file.

Thanks for reading this!
